DONE restore shuffling
DONE restore coloured background on title and menu screens
DONE and manual pin configuration picker
DONE complete high score screen
DONE update high scores to cater for pre-defined levels
DONE allow even width and height (and update pin configs to cater for them, either by excluding some when even dimensions
    are picked, or by allowing a gap of 2 pins in the middle of the play grid)
DONE have separate options / highscore screens for random and pre-defined levels??? (random uses current screen, pre-
    defined has a new one?)
DONE clean up unneeded code
DONE clean up unneeded files
DONE add pause function - this should stop the game timer from incrementing when the game window does not have focus (
    additionally, it should prevent the user from seeing the game board as well.  Maybe a blackout or pretty graphics?)
DONE type hints!
DONE when pins are on rnd choice, score should reflect the randomly chosen pin config, and not "randomised"
DONE level files need to support pin configuration setting
DONE move transition timing values to GameConstants
DONE create a level picker which shows previews of pre-defined levels

random diagonal scoring should be separated by the distance between the diagonals: a gap of 10 is harder than a gap of 3
on highscore screen, "play random" button should load another random level with current settings
when levels01.dat is completed, show user a "You have completed..." screen with an option to quit or load a random level
create a level designer? (complete with custom pin designer?)
update level picker so that only completed levels (plus the next one) are available to play
push as many class variables into __dunder variables as possible
